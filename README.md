# ¡Buenas! I'm Fernando Soto  

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** with a background in **Computer Science & Mathematics**, holding a **B.S. in both fields from Dominican University**. My **Mexican heritage** fuels my creativity, determination, and unique approach to problem-solving.  

I specialize in **C#, React, SQL, Python**, and more—building **efficient, scalable solutions** ranging from web applications to automation tools. But what truly sets me apart? My **endurance mindset**.  

## 🚴‍♂️ Endurance & Engineering: A Unique Blend  
Before 2024, I had **zero** athletic background. That changed fast. What started as a simple goal to complete a **cycling century** turned into an **explosive** year of endurance challenges:  

- **🏔️ Everest** – Climbed 8,848m (Mount Everest’s height) in one ride… in *flat* Chicago!  
- **🚵 Everest ROAM** – 10,000m of climbing + 400km within 36 hours.  
- **🌎 24-hour, 400-mile, Quad-State Bicycle Ride** – Rode across **Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin** in one go.  
- **🏃 Marathon & Ultra-Marathon** – Pushed past my limits and even designed a **run-art** route to hype my friend’s Spartan Race.  

In engineering terms, **my 2024 growth was O(2ⁿ)!** I plan to keep pushing both in tech and endurance sports.

- **Fun Fact**: My 400-mile, 24-hour, Quad-State Bicycle Ride was my last ditch effort at completing a different challenge&mdash;American Century Week! I had done 3 back-to-back centuries,     and it rained on day 4. Instead of doing 2 200-mile rides, I opted to pull the bandage and do a 400-miler!
